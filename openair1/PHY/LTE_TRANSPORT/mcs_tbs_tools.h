\brief This function maps I_tbs to I_mcs according to Table 7.1.7.1-1 in 3GPP TS 36.213 V8.6.0. Where there is two supported modulation orders for the same I_TBS then either high or low modulation is chosen by changing the equality of the two first comparisons in the if-else statement.

\brief This function maps a requested throughput in number of bits to I_tbs. The throughput is calculated as a function of modulation order, RB allocation and number of symbols per RB. The mapping orginates in the "Transport block size table" (Table 7.1.7.2.1-1 in 3GPP TS 36.213 V8.6.0)

\param symbPerRB Number of symbols per resource block allocated to this channel
\return I_TBS given an SE and an N_PRB
