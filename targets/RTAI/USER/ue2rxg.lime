# this file contains the calibration values to compute the RSSI
# we can use three different gain stages (high, low, med) as well as a gain factor for fine tuning
# the three lines in this file gives the total rx gain in dB for the three gain stages if the rx gain is set to 30dB
# high gain
108 108 108 108
# med gain
127 127 127 127
# low gain
120 120 120 120
