1. Make sure you are running a kernel configured and compiled with
   Mobile IPv6 support enabled.  See INSTALL.kernel for more
   information.

2. Run './configure' in the main directory.  You may give any
   additional parameters (e.g. --prefix=/usr, defaults to /usr/local)
   to configure.  See './configure --help' for complete listing.

      * Debug messages

      By default, debug message printing is included in the compiled
      program.  To disable debugging messages use --disable-debug with
      configure, otherwise debug messages will be compiled in.

      * Virtual debug terminal

      To enable virtual terminal for trouble shooting, use --enable-vt
      with configure.  It allows access to some of mip6d state at
      runtime.  Telnet to port 7777 on the localhost.  You should get
      a prompt "mip6d> ".  If needed, the port can be changed with
      daemon option --vt-service=PORT.  Use 'help' to display
      available commands.  Virtual terminal should be disabled, unless
      you are running a test environment.

      * Built-in crypto functions

      By default, OpenSSL is used to provide crypto functions.  If the
      library is not found, MIPL will be compiled to use its own built
      in cryptographic functions.  The default behavior may also be
      overidden using the --with-builtin-crypto option with configure.

   Kernel headers are assumed to be found in /usr/include/linux.  If
   these are not the headers from your current kernel, please specify
   alternative include path, e.g.:

      CPPFLAGS='-isystem /usr/src/linux/include' ./configure

   Note that you may need to specify additional include path, for
   example on x86 architecture such as
   '-isystem /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/include'.

3. Run 'make'.  If everything went ok, you should now have mip6d
   compiled.

4. Run 'make install'.  Executables should now be installed and you
   are ready to configure the node for Mobile IPv6.

   Please refer to configuration file manual page mip6d.conf(5) for
   further information on how to configure your node.  Also take a
   look at the example configuration files in the extras directory.

   For comments about IPsec support check README.IPsec.

5. A startup script 

   To automatically start the Mobile IPv6 subsystem, you need to have
   a startup script.  Many distributions have their own style of
   startup scripts.  We try to provide some scripts in the extras
   directory, but we cannot hope to support all possible variations.
   See if your favorite distribution is supported.  If not, you can
   always write your own.  We will be happy to accept contributed
   startup scripts to be included in subsequent releases.
