 * @ingroup _openair_mac_layer_specs_
 * @{
This subclause describes the primitives for communications between the RRC and MAC sub-layers.


This subclause describes the primitives for communications between the RRC and MAC sub-layers.
The RRC sequence diagrams are shown below.

The primitives responsible for relaying of radio and traffic measurements to the radio resource manager via
RRC signaling are :
-# MAC_MEAS_REQ: enables RRC to request a measurement process in the MAC (one-shot, periodic or event-driven). This configures
a measurement process in the MAC.
-# MAC_MEAS_IND: indicates to RRC that a (periodic) measurement request is available.
-# MAC_MEAS_CONFIRM: enables RRC to acknowledge a MAC-MEAS-Ind.

These associate a set of measurements (described by the MAC_MEAS_t structure) to a particular logical channel.  Each measurement has
an associated period (which can be infinite in the case of a one-shot measurement) and a set of triggers for generating event-driven
instantaneous measurement reports. The latter is typically used to signal events that correspond to degradation or loss of links with respect to
negotiated QoS values.  These consequently trigger reconfiguration of services by the network. The averaging parameters used by the
MAC measurement process is described by the structure MAC_AVG_t. Note that it is the responsibility
of the MAC-layer to relay PHY measurements which are directly available to the scheduling entity in the MAC-layer.
RRC does not directly act on the PHY measurement sub-system.

The primitives responsible for logical channel MAC configuration by the radio resource manager via RRC signaling are

-# MAC_CONFIG_REQ: enables RRC to configure a new logical channel description at the MAC layer.  The associated QoS
descriptor (MAC_LCHAN_DESC contains the parameters defining the logical channel resource scheduling.
-# MAC_CONFIG_CONFIRM: indicates to RRC that a given logical channel has or has not been configured.

The primitives responsible for indicating data synchronization (or loss of) to RRC are
-# MAC_SYNC : indicates to RRC that a physical link for a newly established logical channel has been used (reception) with
success.  The parameter passed indicates the logical channel id.  This represents the event of successfully decoding a particular logical
channel for the first time.  In the event that several logical channels share the same physical resources (e.g. BCCH and CCCH), it
shall only be sent for the logical channel with the lowest id.
-# MAC_OUT_OF_SYNC : UE primitive indicating to RRC that a physical link for a particular Node-B has been lossed.  The parameter
passed indicates the id of the Node-B.  This represents the event of detecting an unacceptable error rate on the CHBCH of the Node-B in question.
and can be used in the case of handover between Node-B's.  Note that this message is redundant since an equivalent way of obtaining the same
result could be based on an event-driven measurement report.
